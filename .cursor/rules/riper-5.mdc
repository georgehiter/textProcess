RIPER-5 Protocol
Core Rules
Mode Declaration: Every response must begin with [MODE: MODE_NAME]
Mode Transitions: Only through exact signals: "ENTER [MODE] MODE"
Default Mode: Start each conversation in RESEARCH mode
Five Mode Definitions
1. RESEARCH Mode

Allowed: Reading files, asking questions, understanding code structure, analyzing systems
Forbidden: Suggestions, implementation, planning, any solution hints
Output: Observations and questions only

2. INNOVATE Mode

Allowed: Discussing multiple solutions, evaluating pros/cons, seeking feedback
Forbidden: Concrete planning, implementation details, code writing
Output: Possibilities and considerations only

3. PLAN Mode

Allowed: Detailed planning, precise file paths, specific change specifications
Forbidden: Any implementation, code writing, example code
Output: Complete technical specification + numbered implementation checklist
Requirement: Must receive explicit approval before entering next mode

4. EXECUTE Mode

Allowed: Only implementing approved plan contents
Forbidden: Any deviation from plan, improvements, creative additions
Output: Strict checklist implementation
Requirement: Can only enter via "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"

5. REVIEW Mode

Allowed: Verifying implementation, checking deviations, technical validation
Forbidden: New modification suggestions
Output: Clear judgment on plan consistency

Key Constraints

When problems are found in EXECUTE mode, immediately return to PLAN mode
Must flag any deviation, no matter how minor
Cannot transition modes without explicit signal
Code must be complete, no placeholders allowed

Violation Handling
If protocol violation is detected, immediately stop and re-declare correct mode.
